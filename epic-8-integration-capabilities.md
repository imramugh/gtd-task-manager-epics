# Epic 8: Integration Capabilities

## Overview
For a GTD system to be truly effective, it must seamlessly integrate with the other tools and applications users rely on in their daily lives. This epic focuses on creating robust integration capabilities that allow the GTD task manager to connect with calendars, email clients, cloud storage services, and other productivity tools, creating a cohesive ecosystem rather than another isolated application.

## User Stories

### US8.1: Calendar Synchronization
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** synchronize my task manager with external calendar services (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar),  
**So that** I can see all my time-based commitments in one place and avoid scheduling conflicts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Two-way synchronization with major calendar providers (Google, Microsoft, Apple)
- Calendar events appear in task manager timeline views
- Due dates and time-specific tasks appear in connected calendars
- Changes made in either system reflect in the other
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Users can select which calendars to sync from external providers
- Calendar colors and categories are preserved in sync
- OAuth2 authentication for secure calendar access

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify two-way sync functions correctly for all supported providers
- Test sync behavior with various calendar event types (all-day, recurring, multi-day)
- Confirm changes in either system propagate correctly
- Test conflict resolution handles edge cases appropriately
- Verify selective calendar sync functions as expected
- Test authentication flow and token refresh processes
- Verify calendar metadata (colors, descriptions) preserves correctly
- Confirm sync works reliably across time zones

### US8.2: Email Integration
**As a** GTD user,  
**I want to** integrate my email client with my task manager,  
**So that** I can quickly convert emails to tasks and maintain inbox zero.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support for major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, IMAP)
- Email forwarding address for automatic task creation
- Browser extension/add-in for direct conversion of emails to tasks
- Converted tasks include original email content and link back to source
- Email attachments can be saved to task attachments
- Tasks created from emails can be assigned contexts and projects
- Two-way status updates (completing a task can archive the email)
- Email templates for task status updates to stakeholders

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify task creation from emails preserves necessary metadata
- Test forwarding address functions correctly for all supported providers
- Confirm browser extensions work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Test attachment handling for various file types and sizes
- Verify bidirectional status updates work reliably
- Test email template system customization and delivery
- Confirm email authentication security follows best practices
- Verify performance with high volume email processing

### US8.3: Cloud Storage Integration
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** connect my reference materials stored in cloud services to my task manager,  
**So that** I can quickly access relevant files when working on tasks and projects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration with major cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Ability to attach cloud documents to tasks and projects
- File preview for common document types without leaving the app
- Search across connected cloud storage from within the task manager
- Automatic organization of task-related files in connected storage
- Version tracking for files associated with tasks
- Permissions management for shared tasks with file attachments
- Offline access to recently accessed cloud files

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify file attachment process works for all supported providers
- Test file preview functionality for various document formats
- Confirm search functionality returns accurate results across providers
- Test automatic organization feature creates appropriate folder structures
- Verify version tracking correctly identifies file changes
- Test permissions handling for shared tasks with attachments
- Confirm offline access caching works as expected
- Verify authentication security and token management

### US8.4: API Development for Third-Party Extensions
**As a** developer or power user,  
**I want to** access a comprehensive API for the GTD task manager,  
**So that** I can build custom integrations and extensions to fit my specific workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- GraphQL endpoint for flexible querying
- Authentication system with API keys and OAuth2
- Webhook support for real-time integration
- Rate limiting and usage monitoring
- Sandbox environment for testing
- SDK libraries for common programming languages
- Developer portal with examples and support resources

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify API endpoint security and authentication mechanisms
- Test API performance under various load conditions
- Confirm GraphQL queries return expected data structures
- Test webhook reliability and error handling
- Verify rate limiting functions correctly
- Test sandbox isolation from production data
- Confirm SDK libraries correctly implement all API functionality
- Verify documentation accuracy and completeness

### US8.5: Import/Export Functionality
**As a** GTD user,  
**I want to** import data from other task management systems and export my data in standard formats,  
**So that** I can migrate between systems without losing information and maintain backups of my data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Import from popular task managers (Todoist, Things, OmniFocus, Asana, Trello)
- Import from standard formats (CSV, iCal, JSON)
- Export to standard formats with complete metadata
- Selective export options (by project, timeframe, context)
- Automated backup scheduling to cloud storage
- Data mapping tool for custom import sources
- Preview imported data before committing changes
- Conflict resolution for imports

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify import correctly maps data from all supported systems
- Test export contains all relevant metadata in usable format
- Confirm selective export filters function correctly
- Test automated backup process reliability
- Verify preview functionality accurately shows mapping results
- Test conflict resolution handles edge cases appropriately
- Confirm large dataset import/export performance
- Verify data integrity after round-trip export/import

## Technical Considerations
- All integrations must use secure authentication methods (OAuth2 preferred)
- API rate limiting must be implemented to prevent abuse
- Webhook implementations should use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Integration connectors should be modular for easy maintenance and updates
- Data syncing must handle conflicting changes gracefully
- Calendar integrations must handle timezone differences correctly
- API versioning strategy needed for long-term compatibility

## Metrics
- Integration adoption rate by integration type
- API usage volume and patterns
- Error rates by integration type
- Email-to-task conversion rate
- Calendar sync conflict rate
- API response time averages
- Import success rate from various sources
- User satisfaction with integration features
