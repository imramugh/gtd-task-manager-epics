# Epic 7: Engaging Interface

## Overview
An engaging and intuitive interface is crucial for maintaining consistent GTD practice. This epic focuses on creating user interfaces that make interacting with the system enjoyable, reduce friction in daily usage, and provide meaningful visualizations of progress and priorities to keep users motivated and effective in their GTD practice.

## User Stories

- Different dashboard layouts can be saved for different devices or contexts

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify all dashboard elements update in real-time
- Test customization options save and restore properly
- Confirm dashboard adapts appropriately to different viewport sizes
- Test performance with various widget combinations
- Verify metrics calculations are accurate
- Test dashboard state persistence across devices
- Confirm contextual changes based on time/location function correctly
- Verify accessibility compliance for all dashboard elements

### US7.2: Focus Mode for Current Actions
**As a** GTD user,  
**I want to** enter a distraction-free focus mode when working on specific tasks,  
**So that** I can concentrate on completing one action at a time without interruptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can enter focus mode from any task view
- Focus mode displays only the current task with relevant details
- System hides notifications and other distracting elements during focus mode
- Focus timer option with customizable Pomodoro-style intervals
- Focus mode captures completion notes and next steps upon task completion
- Focus mode suggests next logical task when current task is completed
- Focus session statistics track productivity patterns over time

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify all UI elements not relevant to current task are hidden in focus mode
- Test that notifications are suppressed during focus sessions
- Confirm timer functions accurately across platform variations
- Test focus completion flow captures all relevant data
- Verify next task suggestions are contextually appropriate
- Test focus statistics accurately record session data
- Confirm keyboard shortcuts for focus mode navigation work correctly

### US7.3: Priority Visualization
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** visually understand the relative priorities of my tasks and projects,  
**So that** I can make better decisions about where to focus my attention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System provides multiple visualization options (kanban boards, heat maps, priority matrices)
- Visualization incorporates due dates, energy levels, and user-defined importance
- Color coding and iconography communicate priority levels clearly
- Visualizations update in real-time as task status changes
- Users can filter visualizations by project, context, or timeframe
- Visualization preferences can be saved and customized
- Interactive elements allow direct manipulation of task properties from visualization view

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify all visualization types render correctly on various devices and screen sizes
- Test responsiveness of real-time updates when task properties change
- Confirm filter combinations produce expected results
- Verify color schemes meet accessibility standards
- Test interactive elements properly update underlying task data
- Confirm saved visualization preferences persist across sessions
- Test performance with large data sets (1000+ tasks)

### US7.4: Progress Tracking and Metrics
**As a** GTD user,  
**I want to** track my productivity and system usage over time,  
**So that** I can identify patterns and improve my personal workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System tracks key metrics (tasks completed, reviews performed, capture rate)
- Visual dashboard shows trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Metrics can be filtered by project, context, or custom tags
- System identifies personal productivity patterns (peak times, contexts)
- Export functionality allows data analysis in external tools
- Gamification elements provide positive reinforcement (streaks, milestones)
- Privacy controls allow users to opt out of specific tracking

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify accurate calculation of all metrics
- Test visualization of trend data with various time periods
- Confirm filters correctly segment metric data
- Test pattern identification algorithm for false positives/negatives
- Verify export formats are compatible with common analysis tools
- Test gamification elements trigger at appropriate thresholds
- Confirm privacy controls effectively limit data collection as specified

### US7.5: Task Completion Workflow
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** have a satisfying and efficient process for completing tasks,  
**So that** I get positive reinforcement and can quickly determine next steps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Simple one-click/tap task completion option
- Visual and optional audio feedback when tasks are completed
- Completed tasks are archived but remain searchable
- Recurring tasks are automatically rescheduled upon completion
- Completion workflow prompts for next action on related project
- Batch completion option for multiple tasks
- Completion notes and time tracking option
- Undo functionality for accidental completions

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify completion animation works across all platforms
- Test recurring task rescheduling with various recurrence patterns
- Confirm next action prompts are contextually relevant
- Test batch completion with various task selection methods
- Verify completion notes are properly saved and associated with tasks
- Test undo functionality with various timing windows
- Confirm completed tasks are properly archived and remain searchable
- Verify performance of completion workflow with rapid task completions

## Technical Considerations
- UI must be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) required for all interface elements
- Animation and visual effects should be configurable for performance/preference
- Dashboard widgets need a consistent API for data access
- Analytics tracking must respect user privacy preferences
- Focus mode should integrate with OS-level Do Not Disturb features where available
- Charts and visualizations should use vector graphics for resolution independence

## Metrics
- User engagement duration and frequency
- Feature usage patterns
- Task completion rates
- Time spent in focus mode vs. regular mode
- User-initiated customization rate
- Correlation between interface engagement and GTD system maintenance
- Retention and churn based on interface interactions
