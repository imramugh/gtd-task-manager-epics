# Epic 10: Collaboration Features

## Overview
While GTD is primarily an individual productivity system, many people work in team environments where collaboration is essential. This epic focuses on implementing collaboration features that allow GTD practitioners to share relevant portions of their system with teammates, delegate tasks, and communicate about shared work while maintaining the integrity of their personal GTD practice.

## User Stories

### US10.1: Shared Projects and Actions
**As a** GTD practitioner working in a team environment,  
**I want to** selectively share projects and actions with collaborators,  
**So that** we can coordinate our work while I maintain control over my personal GTD system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can share specific projects or individual actions with other users
- Granular permission settings (view-only, comment, edit)
- Shared items appear in collaborators' systems with clear ownership indicators
- Changes to shared items sync in real-time across all collaborators
- Project owners can revoke access or change permissions at any time
- Notifications for changes to shared items
- Collaborators can add shared projects to their own contexts
- Privacy controls ensure sensitive personal projects remain private

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify sharing functionality works across different account types
- Test permission levels function correctly for all interaction types
- Confirm real-time sync performance with multiple simultaneous users
- Test ownership/sharing indicators display properly across views
- Verify notification delivery for various change types
- Test permission revocation immediately prevents further access
- Confirm privacy controls prevent unauthorized access
- Verify shared items correctly integrate with collaborators' contexts

### US10.2: Team Contexts
**As a** team leader using GTD,  
**I want to** create and share team contexts,  
**So that** all team members can organize their actions using consistent contextual references.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Team administrators can create team-wide contexts
- Team contexts appear in all team members' context lists
- Context changes synchronize across all team members
- Contexts can be organized hierarchically (departments, projects, locations)
- Team members can filter by team contexts across personal and shared projects
- Usage analytics available for team contexts
- Context color-coding and icons consistent across team members
- Ability to archive outdated team contexts

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify team context creation and propagation to all team members
- Test synchronization speed of context updates
- Confirm hierarchical organization displays correctly for all members
- Verify filtering by team contexts shows appropriate tasks
- Test analytics accurately track context usage
- Confirm visual consistency of context indicators across devices
- Verify context archiving removes from active lists but preserves historical data
- Test performance with large number of team contexts

### US10.3: Delegation Workflow
**As a** GTD user in a management role,  
**I want to** delegate actions to team members and track their status,  
**So that** I can ensure work progresses without keeping all tasks in my personal system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can delegate actions to other system users
- Delegation includes due dates, contexts, and detailed notes
- Delegated items appear in recipient's inbox for processing
- Delegator can track status without manual follow-up
- Recipients can accept, decline, or negotiate delegated items
- Status updates flow back to delegator automatically
- Delegation history is maintained for accountability
- Recurring delegation patterns can be saved as templates

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify delegation process delivers complete task data to recipient
- Test status tracking updates in real-time
- Confirm notification workflow for new delegated tasks
- Test accept/decline/negotiate flows function properly
- Verify delegation history maintains accurate records
- Test template system correctly applies all task properties
- Confirm privacy controls function correctly for delegated tasks
- Verify performance with high-volume delegation patterns

### US10.4: Accountability Tracking
**As a** team leader using GTD,  
**I want to** track team commitments and project progress,  
**So that** I can ensure accountability without micromanaging or constant check-ins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard shows status of all delegated tasks by assignee
- Progress tracking for team projects and shared actions
- Automated reminders for upcoming and overdue delegated items
- Team metrics dashboard for completion rates and productivity trends
- Customizable status update requests at appropriate intervals
- Exception alerts for at-risk deliverables
- Export functionality for status reports
- Privacy controls that respect appropriate management boundaries

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify dashboard correctly displays all relevant delegated tasks
- Test progress tracking accuracy across project lifecycle
- Confirm reminder system delivers notifications appropriately
- Verify metrics calculations accurately reflect team performance
- Test status update requests deliver and collect information effectively
- Verify exception alert triggers function with appropriate sensitivity
- Test report export formats for compatibility with common business tools
- Confirm privacy controls prevent inappropriate monitoring

### US10.5: Communication Tools Within the System
**As a** GTD user collaborating with a team,  
**I want to** communicate about shared tasks and projects without leaving my task manager,  
**So that** relevant discussions stay connected to the work they reference.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Comment threads attached to shared projects and actions
- @mentions to notify specific team members
- Rich text formatting in comments (markdown support)
- File attachments in comments
- Email notifications for comments with direct reply capability
- Activity stream of comments and changes to shared items
- Search functionality across all comments
- Reaction emoji for lightweight acknowledgments

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify comment system maintains thread integrity
- Test @mention notifications deliver promptly to correct users
- Confirm rich text formatting renders correctly across platforms
- Verify file attachments upload, store, and display properly
- Test email notification -> reply workflow functions correctly
- Confirm activity stream updates in real-time
- Verify search returns accurate results from comment content
- Test reaction emoji system functions across device types

## Technical Considerations
- Real-time collaboration requires WebSocket implementation
- Collaboration features must maintain end-to-end encryption where possible
- Permission model needs careful design to prevent data leakage
- Notification system must consolidate updates to prevent overwhelming users
- Database schema should support ownership and sharing metadata
- API endpoints needed for all collaboration features
- Conflict resolution crucial for simultaneous edits
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of communication features

## Metrics
- Collaboration feature adoption rate
- Delegation completion rate
- Average response time to delegated tasks
- Comment engagement per shared item
- Team context usage patterns
- User satisfaction with collaboration tools
- Impact on individual task completion rates when using collaboration
- Cross-user notification engagement rate
