# Epic 5: Context Management

## Overview
Context management is a core concept in the GTD methodology, allowing users to filter and view tasks based on specific contexts such as location, tools available, energy level, or time available. This epic focuses on creating a robust and flexible context management system that helps users make appropriate task choices based on their current situation.

## User Stories

### US5.1: Context Creation and Customization
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** create and customize my own contexts,  
**So that** I can organize my tasks according to my personal work style and environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create new contexts with custom names
- Users can assign icons to contexts for visual recognition
- Users can edit existing contexts (rename, change icon)
- Users can delete contexts they no longer need
- Users can nest contexts hierarchically (e.g., "Computer > Online" or "Errands > Grocery Store")
- System provides default context suggestions during onboarding to help users get started

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify context creation with various name formats and special characters
- Test nested contexts up to 3 levels deep
- Confirm context edits persist across sessions
- Verify deletion works correctly and doesn't orphan tasks
- Test default context creation during new user setup
- Confirm context icons display properly across all platforms

### US5.2: Context-Based Filtering of Actions
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** filter my next actions by context,  
**So that** I can focus on tasks I can complete in my current situation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can view their tasks filtered by a selected context
- Filter view displays all relevant information for each task
- Multiple context filters can be applied simultaneously
- Filter settings persist during user session
- User can quickly switch between contexts with minimal clicks/taps
- Context filters are available in both list and calendar views
- Users can save commonly used context filter combinations

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify filter accurately displays only tasks with the selected context
- Test performance with large number of tasks (1000+)
- Confirm multi-context filtering works with AND/OR logic options
- Test filter persistence across page refreshes and session timeouts
- Verify filter UI works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Ensure saved filter combinations restore properly

### US5.3: Location-Based Contexts
**As a** mobile GTD user,  
**I want to** associate contexts with physical locations,  
**So that** I can see relevant tasks when I'm near the place where I can complete them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can add geographic coordinates to contexts
- Users can set a radius around locations to trigger notifications
- Map interface available for setting locations visually 
- Geo-fencing capability to notify users when they enter a context area
- Privacy settings allow users to enable/disable location tracking
- Offline capability stores location data for previously visited places

**Testing Criteria:**
- Test location accuracy with GPS and network location services
- Verify geofencing triggers notifications correctly in varied environments
- Test battery usage optimization of location services
- Verify location privacy settings work as expected
- Confirm map interface works with various map providers
- Test offline location matching functionality

### US5.4: Time and Energy Level Tagging
**As a** GTD practitioner,  
**I want to** tag my actions with time requirements and energy levels,  
**So that** I can choose appropriate tasks based on my available time and mental state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can tag tasks with estimated time duration (5min, 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr+)
- Users can tag tasks with energy level required (low, medium, high)
- Users can filter tasks by time available and/or energy level
- System suggests appropriate tasks based on user-specified available time
- System suggests appropriate tasks based on user-specified current energy level
- Time and energy filters can be combined with context filters

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify time estimate options work across different task types
- Test energy level UI is intuitive and easy to use
- Verify filter combinations of time, energy and context work correctly
- Test suggestion algorithm accuracy for various time windows
- Confirm task completion updates time metrics for similar future tasks
- Verify persistence of time/energy settings across sessions

### US5.5: Smart Context Suggestions
**As a** GTD user,  
**I want to** receive intelligent context suggestions based on my usage patterns,  
**So that** I can organize my tasks more efficiently without manual context assignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System analyzes patterns in user's task contexts and suggests appropriate contexts for new tasks
- Machine learning algorithm improves suggestions over time based on user acceptance/rejection
- Users can accept or decline context suggestions with a single tap/click
- Confidence level for suggestions is displayed visually
- Users can temporarily disable context suggestions
- System provides explanation for why a particular context was suggested

**Testing Criteria:**
- Test suggestion accuracy improves over time with user feedback
- Verify suggestion UI is unobtrusive yet accessible
- Test edge cases with tasks that don't clearly match existing contexts
- Verify batch processing of context suggestions for multiple tasks
- Test context suggestion with limited historical data
- Confirm suggestion engine respects user privacy settings

## Technical Considerations
- Context data must synchronize across all devices
- Location data must be stored securely with appropriate privacy controls
- Context suggestion algorithms should run locally when possible to preserve privacy
- Context selection UI must be optimized for quick access on mobile
- Database schema should support hierarchical contexts
- API endpoints needed for context CRUD operations

## Metrics
- Number of contexts created per user
- Frequency of context switches
- Task completion rate by context
- Context suggestion acceptance rate
- Time spent in context-filtered views
- Usage patterns for location-based contexts
