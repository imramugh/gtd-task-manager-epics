# Epic 9: Mobile Experience

## Overview
In today's mobile-first world, a robust mobile experience is essential for a GTD system to be truly effective. This epic focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive mobile experience that allows users to capture, process, organize, and review their GTD system on the go, ensuring the system is always available when and where users need it.

## User Stories

- Test app behavior with interruptions (calls, notifications)

### US9.2: Offline Functionality
**As a** mobile GTD user,  
**I want to** use the application even when I don't have internet connectivity,  
**So that** I can capture, access, and update my tasks regardless of network conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All critical app functions work without internet connection
- Changes made offline automatically sync when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution for changes made offline that conflict with server state
- Offline data access for previously loaded projects and tasks
- Offline capture of new items with all metadata
- App clearly indicates sync status (synced, pending, conflict)
- User control over which data is cached for offline use
- Background sync when app is not active

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify all core functions work properly in airplane mode
- Test sync behavior when connection is intermittent
- Confirm conflict resolution functions correctly for various conflict types
- Verify storage usage is reasonable for cached data
- Test performance with large offline data cache
- Confirm sync indicators accurately reflect current state
- Test background sync behavior with OS power saving modes
- Verify data integrity after extended offline use

### US9.3: Mobile-Optimized Capture and Review
**As a** GTD practitioner using a mobile device,  
**I want to** quickly capture thoughts and conduct reviews with interfaces designed specifically for mobile use,  
**So that** I can maintain my GTD practice efficiently even when only using mobile devices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- One-tap capture from home screen or widget
- Voice-to-text capture optimized for mobile
- Camera integration for document/whiteboard capture
- Mobile-optimized daily and weekly review interfaces
- Quick-action shortcuts for common tasks
- Widget support for capture and viewing key lists
- Share extension to capture from other apps
- Notification center/today view integration

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify capture speed meets under 3-second target from device unlock
- Test voice capture accuracy with background noise
- Confirm camera capture produces usable text via OCR
- Verify review interfaces are fully usable on smaller screens
- Test quick actions work correctly from all entry points
- Confirm widget functionality across OS versions
- Test share extension with various content types
- Verify notification center integration refreshes appropriately

### US9.4: Push Notifications
**As a** mobile GTD user,  
**I want to** receive relevant notifications about my tasks and commitments,  
**So that** I can stay on top of my responsibilities without constantly checking the app.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configurable push notifications for due dates, reminders, and delegated task updates
- Context-aware notifications based on time, location, and user preferences
- Silent synchronization of data in the background
- Notification grouping to prevent overwhelming users
- Quick actions available directly from notifications
- Do Not Disturb respect and integration
- Notification permission requested with clear explanation of benefits
- Web push notifications for PWA version

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify notifications trigger correctly based on all criteria types
- Test notification delivery timing accuracy
- Confirm quick actions from notifications function properly
- Verify notifications respect OS-level settings and focus modes
- Test notification grouping and summaries
- Confirm permissions flow follows best practices
- Verify notification behavior when app has been inactive
- Test battery impact of background processes

### US9.5: Touch-Friendly Interface
**As a** mobile GTD user,  
**I want to** interact with my tasks using natural touch gestures and mobile-optimized controls,  
**So that** I can efficiently manage my system without frustration on smaller screens.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Swipe gestures for common actions (complete, defer, delete)
- Drag and drop for organizing and prioritizing
- Context menus optimized for touch interaction
- Form inputs designed for mobile keyboards
- Pull-to-refresh for content updates
- Haptic feedback for key interactions
- Thumb-friendly navigation and action buttons
- Collapsible sections to maximize screen real estate

**Testing Criteria:**
- Verify all gestures are recognized consistently on various devices
- Test touch accuracy for small tap targets
- Confirm drag operations work smoothly across list boundaries
- Verify context menus are easily accessible but not triggered accidentally
- Test form input with various keyboard types and autocorrect settings
- Confirm haptic feedback is appropriate and not excessive
- Verify one-handed operation is possible for core functions
- Test collapsible UI elements maintain state appropriately

## Technical Considerations
- Cross-platform development framework selection (React Native, Flutter, or PWA)
- Offline data sync requires robust conflict resolution strategy
- Local storage management needed for efficient caching
- Push notification services vary by platform and require different implementations
- Battery usage optimization crucial for background operations
- Bandwidth optimization needed for mobile data connections
- Touch interaction requires higher performance targets than desktop UI
- Design system must adapt gracefully between desktop and mobile

## Metrics
- Mobile session frequency and duration
- Capture rate on mobile vs. desktop
- Offline usage patterns
- Push notification engagement rate
- Task completion rate on mobile
- Review completion rate on mobile
- User satisfaction rating for mobile experience
- Performance metrics (load time, frame rate, battery usage)
