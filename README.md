# GTD Task Manager - Epics and User Stories

This repository contains the epics and user stories for a Getting Things Done (GTD) task management application. The project is organized around the core principles of David Allen's GTD methodology, with features designed to support capture, clarification, organization, reflection, and engagement.

## Repository Structure

Each epic is stored in its own markdown file with detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements:

| Epic | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | [User Account Management](epic-1-user-account-management.md) | User registration, authentication, profiles, and security |
| 2 | [Capture System](epic-2-capture-system.md) | Quick input mechanisms across platforms for collecting thoughts and items |
| 3 | [Clarification Process](epic-3-clarification-process.md) | Tools for processing and organizing captured items |
| 4 | [Organization System](epic-4-organization-system.md) | List management, calendar integration, and reference material organization |
| 5 | [Context Management](epic-5-context-management.md) | Creation, customization, and filtering of contexts |
| 6 | [Review Framework](epic-6-review-framework.md) | Daily, weekly, and horizon review tools |
| 7 | [Engaging Interface](epic-7-engaging-interface.md) | Dashboard, focus mode, progress tracking, and task completion workflow |
| 8 | [Integration Capabilities](epic-8-integration-capabilities.md) | Calendar, email, cloud storage integration, and API development |
| 9 | [Mobile Experience](epic-9-mobile-experience.md) | Progressive web app, offline functionality, and mobile optimization |
| 10 | [Collaboration Features](epic-10-collaboration-features.md) | Shared projects, team contexts, delegation, and communication tools |

## Epic Structure

Each epic file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the epic and its importance in the GTD system
2. **User Stories** - Detailed user stories with:
   - As a / I want to / So that format
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Testing criteria
3. **Technical Considerations** - Implementation notes for developers
4. **Metrics** - Success metrics for measuring feature effectiveness

## GTD Methodology

This application is designed around the five core steps of the GTD methodology:

1. **Capture** - Collect what has your attention
2. **Clarify** - Process what it means
3. **Organize** - Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect** - Review frequently
5. **Engage** - Simply do

The epics are organized to support this workflow while providing a modern, user-friendly experience that works across all devices.
