# GTD Task Manager - Epics and User Stories

This repository contains the epics and user stories for a Getting Things Done (GTD) task management application. The project is organized around the core principles of David Allen's GTD methodology, with features designed to support capture, clarification, organization, reflection, and engagement.

Each epic is stored in its own markdown file with detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, and testing requirements:

## Epic Structure

Each epic file follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Brief description of the epic and its importance in the GTD system
2. **User Stories** - Detailed user stories with:
   - As a / I want to / So that format
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Testing criteria
3. **Technical Considerations** - Implementation notes for developers
4. **Metrics** - Success metrics for measuring feature effectiveness

## GTD Methodology

This application is designed around the five core steps of the GTD methodology:

1. **Capture** - Collect what has your attention
2. **Clarify** - Process what it means
3. **Organize** - Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect** - Review frequently
5. **Engage** - Simply do

The epics are organized to support this workflow while providing a modern, user-friendly experience that works across all devices.
