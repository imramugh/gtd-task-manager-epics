## Technical Considerations
- Review data must synchronize across all devices
- Review checklists should be customizable but retain core GTD principles
- Performance optimization needed for large system reviews
- Analytics required for tracking review completion rates
- Notification system must work across platforms and respect Do Not Disturb settings
- Horizon data model must support links between items at different levels

## Metrics
- Review completion rates (daily, weekly, horizons)
- Average time spent in reviews
- Stale item processing rate
- System trust score (user-reported)
- Correlation between review consistency and task completion rates
- User engagement with different review horizons
